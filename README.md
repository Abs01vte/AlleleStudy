# Allele Study
## What
This code will generate a number of individuals bearing a pair of allele markers that are determined by a text file called "genes.txt". Each of the allele pairs in genes.text will be combined with another one in their generation and used to create another set of 4 individuals using the punnett square functionality. It runs for 5 generations and then the rest is compared for similarities, which in a closed breeding pool is a marker for genetic mutation, with the number of similarities printed as a percentage of the whole.

## Genes file
```
A a
B b
C c
D d
```
This is an example of genes.txt.
